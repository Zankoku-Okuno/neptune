Neptune
=======

Neptune is most RESTful web framework in the world. The REST architectural style is a very simple set of constraints, which is what gives it its power to aid application developers, but that same simplicity makes the idea difficult to come to understand. Neptune will, with any luck, clearly display the requirements and benefits of the REST style.

Neptune is written in Haskell. If you already are a Haskeller, this means you can breath easy about reliability, performance, and ease-of-use. If you aren't a Haskeller, then you should be interested in why Haskell seems like such a helpful language. There are lots of [great](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) [resources](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) on the web that can get you up-to-speed enough to use Neptune. We don't recommend jumping straight in, even though the examples look straightforward; when you make a mistake, you'll want to be able to read the error messages.

If you're looking at this in plain text, you can read this documentation in a pleasant format on [Viewdocs](http://Zankoku-Okuno.viewdocs.io/neptune/).

Neptune is distributed primarily in a series of packages hosted on Hackage. It is also on [Github](https://github.com/Zankoku-Okuno/neptune).
