I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand

'Cause I'm a voodoo child
Voodoo child

I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days

If I'll see you no more in this world
I'll meet ya on the next one
Don't be late
Don't be late

Well, I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby
Voodoo Child, Voodoo child, Voodoo child.
